## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm a passionate student nearing graduation from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Economics, Statistics, and Data Science. With a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, I thrive on turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and exploring the intersection of technology and real-world applications.
### Check Out Some of my academic Projects:

**Driver Behavior Detection Using Smartphone Signals**  
   This signal detection project applies machine learning techniques to identify risky driver behavior, leveraging academic publications and open-source datasets for analysis.

**COVID-19 analysis with R**  
   This project conducts an in-depth analysis of global Covid-19 data sourced from Johns Hopkins University (JHU CCSE) using R for data manipulation and visualization. It examines trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations from January 2020 across various countries and continents. Skills utilized in the project include data cleaning and transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effective data visualization techniques to communicate findings clearly. Moreover, it involves analytical thinking to compare regional data and evaluate the effects of vaccinations.

**Textual analysis and Statistical modelling with R**  
   This project focuses on analyzing textual data from the book "Moby-Dick" and implementing the Wordle game. Using R, text is extracted from the book to compute various statistics on word frequencies and chapter structures, accompanied by visualizations for clearer insights. Key skills applied in this project include text manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and probability calculations. Additionally, different strategies for playing Wordle are explored, utilizing simulation and statistical modeling to evaluate their effectiveness.
