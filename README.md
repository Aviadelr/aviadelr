## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm a passionate student nearing graduation from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Economics, Statistics, and Data Science. With a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, I thrive on turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and exploring the intersection of technology and real-world applications.
### Check Out Some of my academic Projects:

1. **Driver Behavior Detection Using Smartphone Signals**  
   This signal detection project applies machine learning techniques to identify risky driver behavior, leveraging academic publications and open-source datasets for analysis.

3. **unix**  
   A big data project focused on processing and analyzing vast geolocation datasets to derive insightful trends. Employing Apache Spark, I built predictive models to forecast traffic patterns based on historical data.

4. **sql**  
   Developed a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka to ingest and analyze streaming data efficiently. This project demonstrates the ability to manage large datasets in real-time applications effectively.

5. **wikipedia network research**  
   Conducted a comprehensive analysis and visualization of earthquake geographical data using R. This project involved advanced statistical methods, sampling techniques, and the application of visualization libraries to interpret data effectively.
