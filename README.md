## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm a passionate student nearing graduation from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Economics, Statistics, and Data Science. With a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, I thrive on turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and exploring the intersection of technology and real-world applications.
### Check Out Some of my academic Projects:

1. **Driver Behavior Detection Using Smartphone Signals**  
   This signal detection project applies machine learning techniques to identify risky driver behavior, leveraging academic publications and open-source datasets for analysis.
