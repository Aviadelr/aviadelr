## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm a passionate student nearing graduation from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Economics, Statistics, and Data Science. With a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, I thrive on turning complex datasets into actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and exploring the intersection of technology and real-world applications.
### Check Out Some of my academic Projects:

**Driver Behavior Detection Using Smartphone Signals**  
   This signal detection project applies machine learning techniques to identify risky driver behavior, leveraging academic publications and open-source datasets for analysis.

**unix**  
   A big data project of a comprehensive analysis of metadata sourced from the arXiv database, utilizing shell commands and Python programming to explore trends in scientific publishing. This project includes tasks like extracting data, analyzing keyword frequencies, and comparing article versions to gain insights into the changing research topics over time. It is advanced techniques for processing large datasets, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful information from complex JSON structures.

**sql**  
   The following MySQL project demonstrates data analysis skills using Google BigQuery and Python to efficiently handle large-scale datasets, specifically NYC 311 service requests..  [View Project](https://github.com/Aviadelr/BigDataAnalysis/blob/main/MidTerm_52002_2022_23_SQL.ipynb)

**wikipedia network research**  
   A project of research techniques to explore the English Wikipedia network from 2002, employing methods such as clustering coefficient calculations, degree distribution analysis, and power law estimations to reveal structural insights. Additionally, implementation of random network simulations, PageRank and Topic-Specific PageRank algorithms, and community detection with the Louvain method.
